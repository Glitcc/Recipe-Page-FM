## My process

I created an HTML file making sure to create classes for customizing using CSS and I worked on CSS to edit the allignments, sizes and other aspects of all the elements and images to make the page look as close to the preview image as possible. Also created custom CSS for mobile devices.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

From this point onwards I intend to polish my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills and build more projects refine my skills.
